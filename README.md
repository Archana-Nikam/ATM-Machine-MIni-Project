# ATM-Machine-MIni-Project
ATM Machine Mini Project (Python)
📌 Overview
This is a console-based ATM Machine simulation built using Python. It utilizes loops and conditional statements to perform fundamental banking operations like checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The project provides a simple yet interactive way to understand banking transactions in a real-world scenario.

🔥 Features
✅ Check Balance – Displays the current account balance.
✅ Deposit Money – Allows users to deposit a specified amount into their account.
✅ Withdraw Money – Enables users to withdraw money while ensuring sufficient balance.
✅ Exit – Allows users to quit the program safely.

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ The program starts with an initial balance of ₹5000.
2️⃣ The user is presented with a menu to select an operation.
3️⃣ Based on the user's choice, the program performs the respective action.
4️⃣ If the user deposits money, it gets added to the balance.
5️⃣ If the user withdraws money, it checks if sufficient funds are available before proceeding.
6️⃣ The loop continues until the user chooses to exit.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Concepts Used: Loops, Conditional Statements (if-elif-else), User Input Handling

🖥️ Sample Output
ATM Machine
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit Money
3. Withdraw Money
4. Exit
Enter your choice (1-4): 2
Deposit the Amount: 3000
Rs.3000 credited to your account. Total balance is: 8000

🏆 Learning Outcomes
✔️ Understanding of loops and conditional statements in Python
✔️ Hands-on experience with user input handling and basic arithmetic operations
✔️ Implementation of a simple but practical banking system
